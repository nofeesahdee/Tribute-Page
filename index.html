            <p><em>Outside the ring, Ali attained success as a musician, where he received two Grammy nominations.
                    He also featured as an actor and writer,releasing two autobiographies. 
                    Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion and charity. In 1984, 
                    he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson's syndrome, which some reports attribute to boxing-related injuries,
                    though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally,
                    but in his later years made increasingly limited public appearances as his condition worsened, 
                    and he was cared for by his family.
